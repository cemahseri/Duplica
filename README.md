# FastestDuplicateFileFinder
Yet another duplicate file finder that's developed by KISS principle. But it's faster. With fast, I mean real fast.

# Usage
Just drag and drop the folder(s) you want to scan, to the executable file.
Or alternatively, you can specify path(s) from the command line.
```
FastestDuplicateFileFinder.exe C:\path\to\your\mom C:\another\path\to\your\mom C:\still\path\to\your\mom
```
